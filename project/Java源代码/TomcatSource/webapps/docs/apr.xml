  <section name="Introduction">

  <p>
      Tomcat can use the <a href="http://apr.apache.org/">Apache Portable Runtime</a> to 
      provide superior scalability, performance, and better integration with native server 
      technologies. The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at 
      the heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to advanced IO
      functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level functionality (random number
      generation, system status, etc), and native process handling (shared memory, NT
      pipes and Unix sockets).
  </p>
  
  <p>
      These features allows making Tomcat a general purpose webserver, will enable much better 
      integration with other native web technologies, and overall make Java much more viable as
      a full fledged webserver platform rather than simply a backend focused technology.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Installation">

    <p>
      APR support requires three main native components to be installed:
      <ul>
        <li>APR library</li>
        <li>JNI wrappers for APR used by Tomcat (libtcnative)</li>
        <li>OpenSSL libraries</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <subsection name="Windows">
    
    <p>
      Windows binaries are provided for tcnative-1, which is a statically compiled .dll which includes
      OpenSSL and APR. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://tomcat.heanet.ie/native/">here</a>
      as 32bit or AMD x86-64 binaries.
      In security conscious production environments, it is recommended to use separate shared dlls
      for OpenSSL, APR, and libtcnative-1, and update them as needed according to security bulletins.
      Windows OpenSSL binaries are linked from the <a href="http://www.openssl.org">Official OpenSSL 
      website</a> (see related/binaries).
    </p>
    
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection name="Linux">
    
    <p>
      Most Linux distributions will ship packages for APR and OpenSSL. The JNI wrapper (libtcnative) will 
      then have to be compiled. It depends on APR, OpenSSL, and the Java headers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Requirements:
      <ul>
        <li>APR 1.2+ development headers (libapr1-dev package)</li>
        <li>OpenSSL 0.9.7+ development headers (libssl-dev package)</li>
        <li>JNI headers from Java compatible JDK 1.4+</li>
        <li>GNU development environment (gcc, make)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The wrapper library sources are located in the Tomcat binary bundle, in the 
      <code>bin/tomcat-native.tar.gz</code> archive.
      Once the build environment is installed and the source archive is extracted, the wrapper library 
      can be compiled using (from the folder containing the configure script):
      <source>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</source>
    </p>
    
    </subsection>

  <section name="APR Components">

  <p>
    Once the libraries are properly installed and available to Java (if loading fails, the library path
    will be displayed), the Tomcat connectors will automatically use APR. Configuration of the connectors
    is similar to the regular connectors, but have a few extra attributes which are used to configure
    APR components. Note that the defaults should be well tuned for most use cases, and additional
    tweaking shouldn't be required.
  </p>

  <p>
    When APR is enabled, the following features are also enabled in Tomcat:
    <ul>
      <li>Secure session ID generation by default on all platforms (platforms other than Linux required
          random number generation using a configured entropy)</li>
      <li>OS level statistics on memory usage and CPU usage by the Tomcat process are displayed by
          the status servlet</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="APR Lifecycle Listener Configuration">
    <subsection name="AprLifecycleListener">
    <attribute name="SSLEngine" required="false">
    <p>
      Name of the SSLEngine to use. off: Do not use SSL, on: Use SSL but no specific ENGINE.
      The default value is on.
      This initializes the native SSL engine, then enable the use of this engine in the connector 
      using the <code>SSLEnabled</code> attribute. Example:
      <source>
&lt;Listener className="org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener" SSLEngine="on" /&gt;
      </source>
    </p>
    </attribute>
    </subsection>
  </section>

  <section name="APR Connectors Configuration">

    <subsection name="HTTP">
    
    <p>
      When APR is enabled, the HTTP connector will use sendfile for hadling large static files (all such
      files will be sent ansychronously using high performance kernel level calls), and will use 
      a socket poller for keepalive, increasing scalability of the server.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following attributes are supported in the HTTP APR connector in addition to the ones supported
      in the regular HTTP connector:
    </p>

    <attributes>
 
    <attribute name="firstReadTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The first read of a request will be made using the specified timeout. If no data is available
      after the specified time, the socket will be placed in the poller. The value of this attribute is
      in ms. Setting this value to 0 or -1 will
      increase scalability by always using a poller to handle keepalive, but will have a minor impact 
      on latency (see the related pollTime attribute). The difference is that with 0, the first read of
      a request will be made using a short timeout, while with -1, the first read will be made using the
      regular socket timeout that is configured on the connector. Setting this to -2 will cause
      the connector to not use the poller for keepalive in most situations, emulating the behavior of
      the java.io HTTP connector.
      The default value is -1. Note: on Windows, the actual value of firstReadTimeout will
      be 500 + the specified value, if the specified value is strictly positive.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="pollTime" required="false">
      <p>Duration of a poll call. Lowering this value will slightly decrease latency of connections 
      being kept alive in some cases, but will use more CPU as more poll calls are being made. The
      default value is 2000 (5ms).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="pollerSize" required="false">
      <p>Amount of sockets that the poller responsible for polling kept alive connections can hold at a
      given time. Extra connections will be closed right away. The default value is 8192, corresponding to
      8192 keepalive connections.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="useSendfile" required="false">
      <p>Use kernel level sendfile for certain static files. The default value is true.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="sendfileSize" required="false">
      <p>Amount of sockets that the poller responsible for sending static files asynchronously can hold 
      at a given time. Extra connections will be closed right away without any data being sent 
      (resulting in a zero length file on the client side). Note that in most cases, sendfile is a call
      that will return right away (being taken care of "synchonously" by the kernel), and the sendfile
      poller will not be used, so the amount of static files which can be sent concurrently is much larger
      than the specified amount. The default value is 1024.</p>
    </attribute>

    </attributes>
    
    </subsection>
	
    <subsection name="HTTPS">
    
    <p>
      When APR is enabled, the HTTPS connector will use a socket poller for keepalive, increasing 
      scalability of the server. It also uses OpenSSL, which may be more optimized than JSSE depending
      on the processor being used, and can be complemented with many commercial accelerator components.
      Unlike the HTTP connector, the HTTPS connector cannot use sendfile to optimize static file
      processing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The HTTPS APR connector has the same basic attributes than the HTTP APR connector, but adds 
      OpenSSL specific ones. For the full details on using OpenSSL, please refer to OpenSSL documentations
      and the many books available for it (see the <a href="http://www.openssl.org">Official OpenSSL 
      website</a>). The SSL specific attributes for the connector are:
    </p>
    
    <attributes>

    <attribute name="SSLEnabled" required="false">
    <p>
      Enable SSL on the socket, default value is false. Set this value to true
      to enable SSL handshake/encryption/decryption in the APR connector.
    </p>
    </attribute>
    <attribute name="SSLProtocol" required="false">
    <p>
      Protocol which may be used for communicating with clients. The default is "all", with
      other acceptable values being "SSLv2", "SSLv3", "TLSv1", and "SSLv2+SSLv3".
    </p>
    </attribute>
    <attribute name="SSLCipherSuite" required="false">
    <p>
      Ciphers which may be used for communicating with clients. The default is "ALL", with
      other acceptable values being a list of ciphers, with ":" used as the delimiter
      (see OpenSSL documentation for the list of ciphers supported).
    </p>
    </attribute>
    <attribute name="SSLCertificateFile" required="true">
    <p>
      Name of the file that contains the server certificate. The format is PEM-encoded.
    </p>
    </attribute>
    <attribute name="SSLCertificateKeyFile" required="false">
    <p>
      Name of the file that contains the server private key. The format is PEM-encoded.
      The default value is the value of "SSLCertificateFile" and in this case both certificate
      and private key have to be in this file (NOT RECOMMENDED).
    </p>
    </attribute>
    <attribute name="SSLPassword" required="false">
    <p>
      Pass phrase for the encrypted private key. If "SSLPassword" is not provided, the callback fonction
      should prompt for the pass phrase.
    </p>
    </attribute>
    <attribute name="SSLVerifyClient" required="false">
    <p>
      Ask client for certificate. The default is "none", meaning the client will not have the opportunity
      to submit a certificate. Other acceptable values include "optional", "require" and "optionalNoCA".
    </p>
    </attribute>
    <attribute name="SSLVerifyDepth" required="false">
    <p>
      Maximum verification depth for client certificates. The default is "10".
    </p>
    </attribute>
    <attribute name="SSLCACertificateFile" required="false">

    <p>
    An example SSL Connector declaration can be:
    <source>
    &lt;Connector port="443" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192"
               maxThreads="150" minSpareThreads="25" maxSpareThreads="75"
               enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true"
               acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true"
               SSLEngine="on" 
               SSLCertificateFile="${catalina.base}/conf/localhost.crt"
               SSLCertificateKeyFile="${catalina.base}/conf/localhost.key" /&gt;</source>
    </p>
    
    </subsection>
	
    <subsection name="AJP">
    
    <p>
      When APR is enabled, the AJP connector will use a socket poller for keepalive, increasing 
      scalability of the server. As AJP is designed around a pool of persistent (or almost
      persistent) connections, this will reduce significantly the amount of processing threads 
      needed by Tomcat. Unlike the HTTP connector, the AJP connector cannot use sendfile to optimize
      static file processing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following attributes are supported in the AJP APR connector in addition to the ones supported
      in the regular AJP connector:
    </p>

    <attributes>
 
    <attribute name="firstReadTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The first read of a request will be made using the specified timeout. If no data is available
