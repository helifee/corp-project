  <section name="Introduction">
  <p>
    A number of additional third party components may be used with Apache Tomcat, but are not
    provided directly in the downlad bundle for a variety of reasons. These may be built by
    users should they need it.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Building">

    <p>
      The additional components are built using the <code>extras.xml</code> Ant script which is
      present in the source bundle of Tomcat.
    </p>
    
    <p>The build process is the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Follow the <a href="building.html">build instructions</a> to build a Tomcat binary from
    the source bundle (note: it will be used by the build process of the additional components, but
    does not need to be actually used later on)</li>
    <li>Execute the command <code>ant -f extras.xml</code> to run the build script</li>
    <li>The additional components JARs will be placed in the <code>output/extras</code> folder</li>
    <li>Refer to the documentation below about the usage of these JARs</li>
    </ul>

  <subsection name="Full commons-logging implementation">

  <p>
    Tomcat uses a package renamed commons-logging API implementation which is hardcoded to use
    the java.util.logging API. The commons-logging additional component builds a full fledged
    package renames commons-logging implementation which can be used to replace the implementation
    provided with Tomcat. See the <a href="logging.html">logging</a> page for usage instructions.
