/**
 * Subclass implementation of <b>java.net.URLClassLoader</b> that knows how
 * to load classes from disk directories, as well as local and remote JAR
 * files.  It also implements the <code>Reloader</code> interface, to provide
 * automatic reloading support to the associated loader.
 * <p>
 * In all cases, URLs must conform to the contract specified by
 * <code>URLClassLoader</code> - any URL that ends with a "/" character is
 * assumed to represent a directory; all other URLs are assumed to be the
 * address of a JAR file.
 * <p>
 * <strong>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE</strong> - Local repositories are searched in
 * the order they are added via the initial constructor and/or any subsequent
 * calls to <code>addRepository()</code>.
 * <p>
 * <strong>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE</strong> - At present, there are no dependencies
 * from this class to any other Catalina class, so that it could be used
 * independently.
